## 9. Paul Costelloe
### Intro
Irish-American designer Paul Costelloe is one of the most established names in British and Irish fashion. Since the establishment of the fashion house under his own name, this family owned and run business has been a leader in the use of hand-crafted, luxurious fabrics combined with cutting edge design, innovation and creativity. Based at his design studio in the heart of London’s fashion district, Paul works with renowned technicians, suppliers and manufacturers to deliver collections of the highest quality, texture and comfort. These include his sampling unit in central London as well as working with a family owned manufacturing unit in the Ancona region of central Italy.

Paul began his path in the fashion industry at the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in Paris but found he learnt more just by living in Paris during the era of Ungardo and Cardin. He was then appointed Design Assistant to Jacques Esterel before moving to Milan to support Marks & Spencer in their drive to enter the Italian market. Although this drive was not successful, Paul stayed on in Milan as designer for the luxury department store La Rinascente. A move to the USA was followed by his appointment as designer to Anne Fogarty in New York after which Paul established his own label, Paul Costelloe Collections.

In 1983 Paul was appointed as the personal designer to Diana, the Princess of Wales; a collaboration that flourished until her untimely death. With the fast growing success of the brand, Paul was invited to show at London Fashion Week in 1984. His upcoming Spring/Summer 2020 collection will celebrate the designer’s 35th year on the LFW catwalk.
The Paul Costelloe name today encompasses a wide range of collections including womenswear, menswear, bags and accessories, homeware, jewellery, eyewear and children’s occasionwear. He has also developed a highly successful business in developing corporate wear concepts for major multi-nationals and sports teams including British Airways, Delta Airlines and the Irish Olympic Team.

Today, Paul continues to lead development of all his collections from his studio in central London.

### 简介
爱尔兰裔美国设计师保罗·科斯特洛（Paul Costelloe）是英国和爱尔兰时尚界最具影响力的名字之一。自成立以来，这家以家族所有和经营的时尚品牌一直引领着手工精制、豪华面料与前沿设计、创新和创意相结合。总部设在伦敦时尚区中心的设计工作室，保罗与知名技术人员、供应商和制造商合作，推出质量、质地和舒适度最高的系列产品。这些包括他在伦敦市中心的样品制作部门以及与意大利中部安科纳地区的家族制造部门合作。

保罗在时尚界的道路始于巴黎高级时装协会（Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture），但他发现仅仅生活在乌加尔多和卡丁时代的巴黎让他学到了更多。他后来被任命为雅克·埃斯特雷尔（Jacques Esterel）的设计助理，然后前往米兰支持马克斯&斯宾塞（Marks & Spencer）进军意大利市场。尽管这一举措并不成功，但保罗留在米兰，成为奢侈百货商店La Rinascente的设计师。之后他前往美国，担任纽约安妮·福加蒂（Anne Fogarty）的设计师，随后成立了自己的品牌Paul Costelloe Collections。

1983年，保罗被任命为威尔士王妃戴安娜的私人设计师；这段合作一直持续到她不幸去世。随着品牌的快速成功，保罗被邀请参加1984年的伦敦时装周。他即将推出的2020年春夏系列将庆祝他在伦敦时装周T台上的第35个年头。

如今，保罗·科斯特洛的品牌涵盖了广泛的系列，包括女装、男装、包袋和配饰、家居用品、珠宝、眼镜和儿童礼服。他还为包括英国航空、达美航空和爱尔兰奥运队在内的大型跨国公司和体育团队开发了极其成功的企业服装概念。如今，保罗继续在伦敦市中心的工作室领导他所有系列的发展。

## 10. MASHA POPOVA
### Intro
Masha Popova is an eponymous brand of the Ukrainian born London based womenswear designer best known for her wearable high-fashion denim designs that fused fantasy with my Ukrainian roots and childhood memories.

Masha Popova graduated from the CSM BA and MA and previously interned at Maison Margiela and Celine. Growing up in Ukraine in the industrial area near the railway depot and later in the Ukrainian seaside city Odesa and studying Architecture before doing a Fashion degree at CSM, has given her a different perspective on fashion.

Masha Popova's work that was seen on Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Bella Hadid and Kylie Jenner among others. Masha Popova is a melting pot of two worlds: late 20s century high fashion juxtaposed with the 90-00s clothing with its raw energy and carefree attitude. Masha Popova's irreverent take on sensuality combined with playful turbulent draping and subversive use of materials, are tools that she uses to create an elegant yet care-free collection.

## 11. Bora Aksu
### Intro
Bora Aksu founded his label in 2002, after graduating from the MA in Fashion Design at Central Saint Martins where garments from his collection were purchased by Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana as inspirational pieces. Following early critical acclaim from the fashion press for his singular approach to occasion wear, Aksu was awarded NEWGEN funding for eight consecutive seasons, and has shown on-schedule at London Fashion Week for the past 14 years. ‘My aim as a designer is to create my own definition of beauty, and for me the female form is the most important tool’ notes Bora Aksu, whose design aesthetic fuses a romantic sensibility with raw elegance. Delicately textured fabrics and whimsical detailing are underpinned by a distinctive twist on tailoring that sees darker, more storied elements temper decorative shapes and a translucent use of colour. ‘There is an imperfection to my work which creates purity and beauty’ the designer explains. Bora Aksu’s deftness of touch and investment in craftsmanship also draws on his Turkish roots, giving his collections a unique demi-couture quality; an element that has distinguished the designer’s position in the fashion industry over the last 15 years. ‘My grandma and my aunt were constantly working on creating something beautiful and I try to bring this handcrafted approach into my own design identity, to make the designs unique, but also to keep craftwork relevant to fashion today’. Most recently Bora Aksu experienced significant expansion in Asia. The label currently has 61 stand alone boutiques across the Asia Pacific region including a flagship store in Beijing. With this growth, a range of dresses, separates and jackets are now being produced in addition to Bora Aksu’s ready-to-wear offering. Combining the designer’s central themes of romanticism and raw elegance with everyday luxury, these additions celebrate a fun, accessible approach to dressing. Over time Bora Aksu’s designs have come to represent a very distinctive and unique voice that remains unparalleled in the industry. The designer has dressed a multitude of film stars including Keira Knightley, Emily Blunt, Rachel McAdams, Elle Fanning , Lucy Boynton, Zoe Kazan, Anya Taylor Joy  Marion Cotillard, Sienna Miller and Zendaya and designed costumes for musicians that include Rita Ora, Lily Allen, Tori Amos and Ellie Goulding. Today the Bora Aksu label is synonymous with an engaging and beguiling take on female style that is distinguished for its exquisite craftsmanship and exceptional demi-couture quality. Consequently, through Bora Aksu’s uncommon approach to femininity, a new narrative around female beauty has emerged.

## 13. Sinéad O'Dwyer
### Intro
Since her 2018 graduation from the MA Fashion program at London’s Royal College of Art, Sinéad O’Dwyer’s eponymous label has adamantly reframed common misconceptions around garments and the bodies they’re intended for. Rallying against a sample-size-oriented design logic, her work explores silicone moulding, stretch and innovative pattern-making as technologies to comfortably accommodate femme-identifying bodies that have historically been precluded access to luxury ready-to-wear. Swirling shirred satin leggings and jumpsuits embrace and accent and the wearer’s contours, while formal shirts, abbreviated cocktail dresses, and leather overcoats are constructed with darted busts. With an aesthetic tone that hangs in a balance between the domme-ish vigour implied by silicone nipple pasties and thigh-cladding leather boots, and the delicate sensuality of coils of candy cotton pink chiffon, Sinéad O’Dwyer’s designs reflect the kaleidoscopic spectrum of feminine expression for all body shapes and sizes.

### 简介
自2018年毕业于伦敦皇家艺术学院时装设计硕士项目以来，Sinéad O’Dwyer的同名品牌一直坚定地重新定义了关于服装和穿着者身体的常见误解。她的作品反对以样衣尺寸为导向的设计逻辑，探索硅胶成型、拉伸和创新裁剪等技术，舒适地容纳那些历史上被排除在奢侈成衣之外的女性身体。涡纹缝制的绸缎紧身裤和连体裤包裹并突显穿着者的轮廓，而正式衬衫、缩短的鸡尾酒连衣裙和皮大衣则采用有褶饰的胸部设计。在硅胶乳头贴和紧身皮靴所暗示的domme风格活力与棉花糖粉色雪纺轻纱的细腻性感之间保持平衡的审美调子中，Sinéad O’Dwyer的设计反映了各种身形和尺寸的女性表达的万花筒般多样性。
