# Intro

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:
* **Are Context-Aware**: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
* **Reason**: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

The main value props of LangChain are:
* **Components**: abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
* **Off-the-shelf chains**: a structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks

Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. For complex applications, components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones.

## Modules

LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and external integrations for the following modules, listed from least to most complex:

### Model I/O
Interface with language models

### Retrieval
Interface with application-specific data

### Chains
Construct sequences of calls

### Agents
Let chains choose which tools to use given high-level directives

### Memory
Persist application state between runs of a chain

### Callbacks
Log and stream intermediate steps of any chain
