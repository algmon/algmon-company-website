## Vector Stores
### Chroma
Chroma is a AI-native open-source vector database focused on developer productivity and happiness. Chroma is licensed under Apache 2.0.

Install Chroma with:

```python "
pip install chromadb
```

Chroma runs in various modes. See below for examples of each integrated with LangChain.

* in-memory - in a python script or jupyter notebook
* in-memory with persistance - in a script or notebook and save/load to disk
* in a docker container - as a server running your local machine or in the cloud

Like any other database, you can:

* .add
* .get
* .update
* .upsert
* .delete
* .peek
* and .query runs the similarity search.

To access these methods directly, you can do ._collection.method()

#### Basic Examples

In this basic example, we take the most recent State of the Union Address, split it into chunks, embed it using an open-source embedding model, load it into Chroma, and then query it.

```python "
# import
from langchain.embeddings.sentence_transformer import SentenceTransformerEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader

# load the document and split it into chunks
loader = TextLoader("../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()

# split it into chunks
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# create the open-source embedding function
embedding_function = SentenceTransformerEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# load it into Chroma
db = Chroma.from_documents(docs, embedding_function)

# query it
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity_search(query)

# print results
print(docs[0].page_content)
```
