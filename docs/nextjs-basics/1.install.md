# Install

System Requirements:
* Node.js 18.17 or later.
* macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

## Automatic Installation

We recommend starting a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```bash "
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```bash "
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

After the prompts, create-next-app will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.
* Next.js now ships with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS configuration by default.
* You can optionally use a src directory in the root of your project to separate your application's code from configuration files.
