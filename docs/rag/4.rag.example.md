# RAG example

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot represents a cutting-edge approach in conversational artificial intelligence. RAG combines the powers of retrieval-based and generative methods to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses. RAG can leverage a large corpora of text to retrieve relevant documents and then send those documents to language models, such as GPT-4, to generate replies. This methodology ensures that the chatbot's answers are both informed by vast amounts of information and tailored to the specifics of the user's query.

Suppose you have implemented a semantic search system as described in the previous section, and as a result of the search process, you have retrieved the most relevant document, referred to as retrieved_doc.

Now you can utilize a text generation model like GPT-4 to craft a response based on the provided query and the retrieved document. Install the openai package first:

```bash "
pip install openai
```

Then run the following code:
```python "
import openai

# Initialize OpenAI API
openai.api_key = 'YOUR OPENAI API KEY'

# Take the retrieved document and use it as a prompt for the text generation model
prompt = f"Based on the information: '{retrieved_doc}', generate a response of {query}"

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

Output:
```bash "
"Apple's conference call is scheduled for Thursday, November 2, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET."
```

OpenAI output without using retrieved documents:
```bash "
"I'm sorry, but I don't have access to real-time information, including specific scheduling details for events like Apple's conference calls. To find out the date and time of Apple's upcoming conference call, I recommend visiting Apple's official website or checking with reliable news sources or financial websites that cover such events. They typically provide information about scheduled conference calls and other important announcements related to the company."
