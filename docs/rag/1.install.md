# 1.Install

You can interact with the API through HTTP requests from any language. Alternatively, you can use our official Python library, which can be installed via pip:

```python "
pip install voyageai
```

You can test the installation by running this command:

```python "
python -c "import voyageai"
```

## Authentication with API keys

Voyageai utilizes API keys to monitor usage and manage permissions. To obtain your key, first create an account by clicking the "SIGN IN" button on our homepage. Once signed in, access your API key by clicking "View API key" in the dashboard.

Your API key is supposed to be secret -- please avoid sharing it or exposing it in browsers or apps. Please store your API key securely for future use, e.g., via the following bash command.

```bash "
export VOYAGE_API_KEY = '[ Your VOYAGE API key ]'
```

Alternatively, the API key can be set in python (after you install the python bindings):

```python "
import voyage
voyage.api_key = "[ Your VOYAGE API key ]"
```
