## Intro
G-Star said: "We love to innovate and bring new tools within the design process and integrating AI into it can provide benefits such as increased efficiency and accuracy. It can also help reduce waste in the production process by immediately visualizing a raw idea into a well-made outcome. But it's important to note that AI is a tool. It's the human designer who ultimately makes the creative decisions."
