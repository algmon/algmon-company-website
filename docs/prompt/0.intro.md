# 0.简介

This guide is based on lessons learned from researching and creating Large Language Model (LLM) prompts for production use cases. It covers the history around LLMs as well as strategies, guidelines, and safety recommendations for working with and building programmatic systems on top of large language models, like [OpenAI's GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) and [Google's Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction).

The examples in this document were generated with a non-deterministic language model and the same examples may give you different results.

This is a living document. The state-of-the-art best practices and strategies around LLMs are evolving rapidly every day. Discussion and suggestions for improvements are encouraged.
