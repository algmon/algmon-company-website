# Quickstart
Chroma is a database for building AI applications with embeddings. It comes with everything you need to get started built in, and runs on your machine. A hosted version is coming soon!

1. Install

```python "
pip install chromadb
```

2. Get the Chroma Client

```python "
import chromadb
chroma_client = chromadb.Client()
```

3. Create a collection

Collections are where you'll store your embeddings, documents, and any additional metadata. You can create a collection with a name:

```python "
collection = chroma_client.create_collection(name="my_collection")
```

4. Add some text documents to the collection

Chroma will store your text, and handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically.

```python "
collection.add(
    documents=["This is a document", "This is another document"],
    metadatas=[{"source": "my_source"}, {"source": "my_source"}],
    ids=["id1", "id2"]
)
```

If you have already generated embeddings yourself, you can load them directly in:

```python "
collection.add(
    embeddings=[[1.2, 2.3, 4.5], [6.7, 8.2, 9.2]],
    documents=["This is a document", "This is another document"],
    metadatas=[{"source": "my_source"}, {"source": "my_source"}],
    ids=["id1", "id2"]
)
```

5. Query the collection

You can query the collection with a list of query texts, and Chroma will return the n most similar results. It's that easy!

```python "
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=["This is a query document"],
    n_results=2
)

print(results)
```

6. Results
```python "
{'ids': [['id1', 'id2']], 'distances': [[0.7111215591430664, 1.0109773874282837]], 'metadatas': [[{'source': 'my_source'}, {'source': 'my_source'}]], 'embeddings': None, 'documents': [['This is a document', 'This is another document']], 'uris': None, 'data': None}
```
