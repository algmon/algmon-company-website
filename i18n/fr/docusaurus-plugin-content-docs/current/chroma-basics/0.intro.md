Chroma gives you the tools to:

* store embeddings and their metadata
* embed documents and queries
* search embeddings

Chroma prioritizes:

* simplicity and developer productivity
* analysis on top of search
* it also happens to be very quick

Python

In Python, Chroma can run in-memory or in client/server (in alpha) mode.

```bash "
pip install chromadb
```

JavaScript

In JavaScript, Chroma runs in client/server mode and talks to a Python backend.

```bash "
npm install --save chromadb # yarn add chromadb
```
