# Introduction

IOTA is a distributed ledger technology (_DLT_) that empowers individuals to have control over their private data, run
tamper-proof programs, and engage in asset ownership and trading without the need for intermediaries. DLTs, as the name
suggests, maintain a ledger of token ownership across multiple nodes. However, unlike centralized systems, DLTs require
consensus among independent nodes to agree on the ledger's state. This introduces the challenge of protecting the
network from malicious actors. IOTA takes a unique approach, setting it apart from other protocols.
